# Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment

This phase focused on identifying and validating potential weaknesses in the
services discovered during reconnaissance. Testing was performed using
Metasploit auxiliary modules to assess authentication behavior, service
exposure, and known vulnerability indicators.

## SSH User Enumeration Assessment

The SSH service was tested to determine whether it leaked valid or invalid
username information based on response behavior.

### Module Used

```
use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_enumusers
set RHOSTS 10.128.0.226
set USER_FILE /opt/metasploit-framework/embedded/framework/data/wordlists/unix_users.txt
run
```

### Result

- No definitive user enumeration vulnerability was confirmed.
- The SSH service did not clearly disclose valid or invalid usernames based on
  response behavior.
- Enumeration resistance suggests a hardened SSH configuration.

### Assessment

While no exploitable user enumeration flaw was identified, this test validated
that SSH was not trivially leaking account information, reducing the likelihood
of targeted brute-force attacks.

## SSH Honeypot / Weak Key Detection

The `detect_kippo` module was used to identify whether the SSH service was a
honeypot or using deceptive authentication mechanisms.

### Module Used

```
use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/detect_kippo
set RHOSTS 10.128.0.226
run
```

### Result

- No evidence of a Kippo or similar SSH honeypot was detected.
- SSH appeared to be a legitimate OpenSSH service.

### Assessment

The absence of honeypot indicators confirmed that the SSH service was a real,
production-like service and not designed to deceive attackers. This increased
confidence in the accuracy of further SSH-related assessments.

## Vulnerability Database and Workspace Management

To maintain structured tracking of findings, a dedicated Metasploit workspace
was created.

### Workspace Creation

```
workspace -a advanced_lab
```

This workspace was used to organize hosts, services, and vulnerabilities
identified throughout the assessment.

---

## Host Information Storage

Discovered hosts were reviewed and stored within the active workspace.

```
hosts
```

### Result

- Target host `10.128.0.226` was successfully registered in the workspace.

---

## Service Information Storage

All identified network services were listed and stored for correlation with
potential exploits.

```
services
```

### Result

The following services were recorded:

- FTP (21)
- SSH (22)
- Telnet (23)
- Backdoor listener (6200)

Service enumeration data was retained for correlation with exploitation
activity.

---

## Vulnerability Tracking

Identified vulnerabilities were reviewed using Metasploit’s vulnerability
tracking functionality.

```
vulns
```

### Result

- FTP service vulnerability (vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor) recorded
- Telnet authentication weakness implicitly identified
- No SSH vulnerabilities recorded

---

## Vulnerability Assessment Summary

The vulnerability assessment phase confirmed that the most critical weaknesses
were associated with legacy and insecure services rather than SSH. The FTP
service running `vsftpd 2.3.4` and the exposed Telnet service represented the
primary attack vectors. SSH was found to be relatively hardened and resistant
to common enumeration and brute-force techniques.
