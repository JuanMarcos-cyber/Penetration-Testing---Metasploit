# Phase 2 – Vulnerability Assessment

## Objective
The objective of this phase was to analyze the services and versions identified
during reconnaissance and determine whether known vulnerabilities were present.
No exploitation was performed during this phase.

## Identified Vulnerabilities

### 1. VSFTPD v2.3.4 Backdoor Command Execution

- **Service:** FTP  
- **Port:** 21/TCP  
- **Software:** vsftpd  
- **Version:** 2.3.4  
- **Severity:** Critical  

The FTP service was running vsftpd version 2.3.4, which is known to contain a
malicious backdoor introduced in a compromised distribution. This vulnerability
allows unauthenticated remote command execution when a specially crafted
username is supplied during login.

**Impact:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Immediate root-level access
- Full system compromise

---

### 2. Telnet Service with Weak Authentication

- **Service:** Telnet  
- **Port:** 23/TCP  
- **Severity:** High  

The Telnet service was exposed and allowed authentication using weak credentials.
Telnet transmits credentials in cleartext and provides no encryption, making it
highly insecure in modern environments.

**Impact:**
- Credential interception
- Unauthorized system access
- Increased attack surface

---

### 3. Insecure Service Exposure

- **Services Affected:** FTP, Telnet  
- **Severity:** Medium  

Multiple legacy and insecure services were exposed directly to the network. This
indicates a lack of service hardening and insufficient attack surface reduction.

**Impact:**
- Easier service enumeration
- Increased likelihood of automated attacks
- Expanded attack surface

---

## Non-Exploitable Findings

### SSH Service

- **Service:** SSH  
- **Port:** 22/TCP  
- **Version:** OpenSSH 8.4p1  

The SSH service was identified as a modern implementation and did not exhibit
obvious vulnerabilities. Brute-force attempts were unsuccessful, indicating
proper authentication controls.

---

## Risk Summary

| Service | Port | Issue | Severity |
|--------|------|-------|----------|
| FTP | 21 | vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor | Critical |
| Telnet | 23 | Weak authentication / cleartext | High |
| SSH | 22 | No exploitable issues observed | Low |

---

## Vulnerability Assessment Summary

The vulnerability assessment confirmed the presence of a critical backdoor in
the FTP service, which represented a direct path to full system compromise.
Additional insecure services such as Telnet further increased overall risk.
Based on these findings, exploitation was justified and performed in the next
phase of the lab.
