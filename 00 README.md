# Metasploit Penetration Testing Lab

This repository documents a controlled penetration testing lab focused on
service enumeration, vulnerability identification, and controlled exploitation
using Metasploit Framework.
This project demonstrates real-world Metasploit usage beyond “run exploit”, 
focusing on methodology, automation, and risk validation.

## Key Activities
- Automated reconnaissance using Metasploit resource scripts
- Service and version enumeration (FTP, SSH, Telnet)
- Exploitation of vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor vulnerability
- Post-exploitation system enumeration

## Disclaimer
All testing was performed in an isolated lab environment for educational purposes only.
